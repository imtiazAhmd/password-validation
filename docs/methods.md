# Code description

## revealPassword

> **_Location:_** assets/js/password_validation.js line: 2-10

This function is used to toggle the visibility of the password in a password field. It first gets the password field element by its ID. Then it checks the current type of the password field. If it's "password", it changes it to "text", which will reveal the password characters. If it's not "password" (which means it's "text"), it changes it back to "password", which will hide the password characters.

## validatePassword

> **_Location:_** assets/js/password_validation.js line: 13-20

This JavaScript function, `validatePassword`, is used to validate a password based on several conditions:

- `hasValidLength`: Checks if the password length is 8 or more.
- `hasCapitalLetter`: Checks if the password contains at least one uppercase letter. It uses a regular expression (`/[A-Z]/`) to test for uppercase letters.
- `hasLowerCaseLetter`: Checks if the password contains at least one lowercase letter. It uses a regular expression (`/[a-z]/`) to test for lowercase letters.
- `hasNumber`: Checks if the password contains at least one number. It uses a regular expression (`/\d/`) to test for numbers.
- `hasUnderscore`: Checks if the password contains at least one underscore. It uses a regular expression (`/_/`) to test for underscores.

The function takes a `password` as an argument and returns an object with the results of these checks. Each property in the returned object corresponds to a validation check and its value is a boolean indicating whether the password meets that condition.

## handlePasswordInput

> **_Location:_** assets/js/password_validation.js line: 23-54

This function is used to provide real-time feedback on the password as the user types into the password field. It shows the user which conditions the password meets and which it doesn't, helping the user to create a password that meets all the conditions.

`handlePasswordInput`, is an event handler for the input event of a password field. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

- It retrieves the value of the password field.

- If the password is empty, it hides the password rules (a list of conditions that the password should meet) and exits the function.

- If the password is not empty, it shows the password rules.

- It validates the password using the validatePassword function, which checks if the password meets several conditions and returns an object with the results.

- It maps the validation results to the corresponding li elements in the password rules. Each li element corresponds to a validation condition and has an id that matches the name of the condition.

- It iterates over the validation results. For each result, it finds the corresponding li element and updates its innerHTML to show a check icon if the condition is met or a cross icon if the condition is not met.
