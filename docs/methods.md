# revealPassword

This function is used to toggle the visibility of the password in a password field. It first gets the password field element by its ID. Then it checks the current type of the password field. If it's "password", it changes it to "text", which will reveal the password characters. If it's not "password" (which means it's "text"), it changes it back to "password", which will hide the password characters.
