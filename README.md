# Basic password validation

## Goal

The password will be provided by the user (as an argument of the method) and should return if the password is valid or not.

A valid password should meet the following criteria:

- Have more than 8 characters
- Contains a capital letter
- Contains a lowercase
- Contains a number
- Contains an underscore

## Repository

The project is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/imtiazAhmd/password-validation.git](https://github.com/imtiazAhmd/password-validation.git).

## Prerequisites

You need to have `node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine to run this project.
